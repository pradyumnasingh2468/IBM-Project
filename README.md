🔥 Calorie Burn Classification Using IBM SPSS Modeler
📘 Overview

This project focuses on classifying the calorie burn level (Low, Medium, High) based on user health and fitness attributes such as age, gender, BMI, workout type, and physical exercise. Using IBM SPSS Modeler, the dataset was cleaned, processed, and analyzed to build a classification model that predicts calorie burn categories.

🧩 Features

Data preprocessing and anomaly handling (e.g., Physical Exercise field)

Classification modeling using decision tree algorithms

Evaluation of model performance (accuracy and confusion matrix)

Insights on key factors influencing calorie burn level

🧠 Tools & Technologies

IBM SPSS Modeler – for data cleaning, modeling, and evaluation

CSV Dataset – Final_data.csv (input dataset)

⚙️ Workflow

Imported and audited dataset in IBM SPSS Modeler

Fixed anomalies in the Physical Exercise column

Defined field roles and measurement types

Partitioned data into training and testing sets

Built and tested a classification model (Decision Tree / C5.0)

Evaluated model performance and visualized results

📊 Outcome

A predictive classification model that accurately identifies calorie burn level based on fitness and nutrition parameters, enabling better workout and dietary recommendations.
